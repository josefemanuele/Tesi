# Tesi
This master's thesis project studies strategies for translating human language into machine-interpretable 
and actionable instructions. It studies algorithms of machine learning to make an agent automatically
reach a desired outcome in a simulated environment. The main objective of this work is to create a
full-fledged human-to-machine communication framework for expressing situations, rules, and desired outcomes.
