# Tesi
This master's thesis project studies strategies for translating human language into machine-interpretable 
and actionable instructions. It studies algorithms of machine learning to make an agent automatically
reach a desired outcome in a simulated environment. The main objective of this work is to create a
full-fledged human-to-machine communication framework for expressing situations, rules, and desired outcomes,
toghether with an analysis of its performances, inner workings and future improvements.

# Roadmap
The project work was structured in the following development steps:

- Study GridWorld environment project ✅ ⭕
- Study Lang2LTL translation project ✅ ⭕
- Solve Reward machine learning on GridWorld environment with DDQN (reinforcement learning, off-policy training) ✅ ⭕
- Solve Reward machine learning on GridWorld environment with PPO (reinforcement learning, on-policy training) ✅ ⭕
- Solve Reward machine learning on GridWorld environment with visual input (computer vision) ✅ ⭕
- Translate human language task into LTL (natural language processing) ✅ ⭕
- Augment input data for NL to LTL translation (data augmentation) ⭕
- Fine-tune Lang2LTL parameters for improved performances on GridWorld environment (prompt engineering) ⭕
- Study translation precision and accuracy (statistical analysis) ⭕
- Code external automaton wrapper for GridWorld environment ✅ 
- Compare Reward machine learning performances between correct and translated LTL formulas (data visualization)✅ ⭕
- Consider strategies for improving performances and applications ⭕
- Research about background, state of the art, and best practices ⭕
