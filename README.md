# Tesi
This master's thesis project studies strategies for translating human language into machine-interpretable 
and actionable instructions. It studies algorithms of machine learning to make an agent automatically
reach a desired outcome in a simulated environment. The main objective of this work is to create a
full-fledged human-to-machine communication framework for expressing situations, rules, and desired outcomes.

# Roadmap
The project work was structured in the following development steps:

## Study GridWorld environment project ✅ ⭕

## Study Lang2LTL translation project ✅ ⭕

## Solve GridWorld environment with DDQN (reinforcement learning, off-policy training) ✅ ⭕

## Solve GridWorld environment with PPO (reinforcement learning, on-policy training) ✅ ⭕

## Solve GridWorld environment with visual input (computer vision) ✅ ⭕

## Translate human language task into LTL (natural language processing) ✅ ⭕

## Augment input data for NL to LTL translation (data augmentation) ⭕

## Study translation precision and accuracy (statistical analysis) ⭕

## Code external automaton wrapper for GridWorld environment ✅ 

## Compare GridWorld environment solution between correct and translated LTL formulas (data visualization)✅ ⭕
